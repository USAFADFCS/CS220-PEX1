Is it really possible to be a programmer and to be cool at the same time?  I am living proof. I write iPhone and iPad apps for a company that sells solar panels all over the country. I know I’m cool, because when my teenage sons’ friends’ find out that’s what I do, they go, like, “Cool!”, or sometimes, “Awesome”. As far as I know, awesome is a subset of cool.
